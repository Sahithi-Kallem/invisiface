# InvisiFace: Face Anonymizer and Digital Identity Protection System

InvisiFace is a web-based application that protects individuals from facial recognition technologies and deepfake abuse. It uses adversarial cloaking techniques to modify user images in a way that prevents machine learning models from recognizing the face, without altering it noticeably to humans.
